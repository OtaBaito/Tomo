# Privacy Policy

Friday, 3 December 2021

In short, we only collecting your data for profiling and verifying authenticity of your profile, we don't share your data to third party, third party marketing that using email for promotions would be sanitised and ensure no tracker could linked to your account except identifier for every links you clicked would be identified only as Tomodachi Click and they would always don't know the person who clicked.

Your data might be used for marketing as "percentile" of information, we only sell demographics as group but not individuals and you could tweak this manually in settings, also everything you clicked "Delete" will not instantly deleted but instead put on grace period for couple weeks and "shredded" for good.

This policy was temporary for at least 2 month, we should make our policy more detailed and clear, we always tried to protect your data at best and also still make income for the organisation which is making your experience better too.

*This policy should be updated on 3 February 2021.*
